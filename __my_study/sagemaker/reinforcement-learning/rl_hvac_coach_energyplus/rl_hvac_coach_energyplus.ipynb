    "# HVAC with Amazon SageMaker RL\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning and is responsible for keeping us warm and comfortable indoors.  HVAC takes up a whopping 50% of the energy in a building and accounts for 40% of energy use in the US [1, 2]. Several control system optimizations have been proposed to reduce energy usage while ensuring thermal comfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern buildings collect data about the weather, occupancy and equipment use. All of this can be used to optimize HVAC energy usage. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a good fit because it can learn how to interact with the environment and identify strategies to limit wasted energy. Several recent research efforts have shown that RL can reduce HVAC energy consumption by 15-20% [3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "As training an RL algorithm in a real HVAC system can take time to converge as well as potentially lead to hazardous settings as the agent explores its state space, we turn to a simulator to train the agent. [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) is an open source, state of the art HVAC simulator from the US Department of Energy. We use a simple example with this simulator to showcase how we can train an RL model easily with Amazon SageMaker RL.\n",

    "1. Objective: Control the data center HVAC system to reduce energy consumption while ensuring the room temperature stays within specified limits.\n",
    "2. Environment: We have a small single room datacenter that the HVAC system is cooling to ensure the compute equipment works properly. We will train our RL agent to control this HVAC system for one day subject to weather conditions in San Francisco.  The agent takes actions every 5 minutes for a 24 hour period. Hence, the episode is a fixed 120 steps. \n",
    "3. State: The outdoor temperature, outdoor humidity and indoor room temperature.\n",
    "4. Action: The agent can set the heating and cooling setpoints. The cooling setpoint tells the HVAC system that it should start cooling the room if the room temperature goes above this setpoint. Likewise, the HVAC systems starts heating if the room temperature goes below the heating setpoint.\n",
    "5. Reward: The rewards has two components which are added together with coefficients: \n",
    "    1. It is proportional to the energy consumed by the HVAC system.\n",
    "    2. It gets a large penalty when the room temperature exceeds pre-specified lower or upper limits (as defined in `data_center_env.py`).\n",
