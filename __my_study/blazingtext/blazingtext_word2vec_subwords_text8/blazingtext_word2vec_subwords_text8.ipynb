    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a popular algorithm used for generating dense vector representations of words in large corpora using unsupervised learning. These representations are useful for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and machine translation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. *SageMaker BlazingText* can learn vector representations associated with character n-grams; representing words as the sum of these character n-grams representations [1]. This method enables *BlazingText* to generate vectors for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, as demonstrated in this notebook.\n",
